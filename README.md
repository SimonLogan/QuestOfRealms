# QuestOfRealms
A new take on an old-school text-based adventure.

QuestOfRealms was intended as a "just good enough" implementation to allow students to
improve their programming skills by enhancing the game. It includes technologies that
are likely to be encountered in modern software development:
- node.js-based client-server app
- web application frameworks (sails.js, express, backbone)
- document database (mongodb)
- client-side javascript libraries (jQuery)

The game includes a game editor and the ability to play games.
The framework is designed for modding, and you can add your own characters and
specify their attributes and behaviours - create subdirectories in QuestOfRealms/assets/QuestOfRealms-plugins/
Some examples are provided in QuestOfRealms-plugins/default
