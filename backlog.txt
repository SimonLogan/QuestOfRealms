Objectives editor
=================

1. Need to be able to set the game start position
2. Need to set an objective for completing the game.
   Initially support objective types:
   - Reach location


Create game
===========

1. What you create in the game editor is a game template. To actually play a game you need to clone the template.
- How to do this in mongo? In an SQL db I'd just copy all rows in each table an increment the gameId column.
  In mongo do I need to iterate through all the documents fixing up links manually?
2. I haven't decided whether you'll create a game from the game menu (with a list of templates) or from
   the templates menu (with a "Create game" option on each).


Game menu
=========

1. List existing games.
2. Play existing game.
   2.1 Needs map window and command window.
   2.2 Initially support only commands:
   - Move : move to new location.
            When you enter a location it must give a high-level description.
   - Look : with arg "around". Look around means describe your current location in detail.
   2.3 Eventually may have chat window to chat to other players.
   2.4 When does game finish: when all objectives are complete.
3. Decide on model: client-side logic with pubsub like the designer, or server-side command-srived logic.
